  "summary": "REQ-37 and REQ-38 appear to be implemented: the diff indicates Brain Dump clearing is hardened to only affect Brain Dump storage keys and Brain Dump UI helper text was added/adjusted to clarify backlog tasks remain.

      "description": "Added/expanded Brain Dump speech-to-text functionality (listening state, transcript append, resetTranscript, mic icons) beyond the requested backlog persistence + helper text change.",
      "reason": "BuildRequest only asks to ensure clearing Brain Dump does not affect backlog tasks and to add helper copy near clear action; speech-to-text is not requested.",

      "reason": "Not requested by REQ-37/REQ-38; these relate to categorization/editing behavior rather than clearing behavior or helper text.",
