  "summary": "Diff shows BrainDumpView now has a local, deterministic “Convert to Tasks” conversion handler using extractTasksFromBrainDump(), and no evidence of external AI/LLM calls. However, due to truncation, the diff summary does not provide explicit evidence that all “Energy Assistant” UI/copy references were removed or that helper/description copy was updated as requested.",

      "id": "REQ-28",
      "requirement": "Remove the Energy Assistant action/button from the Brain Dump view UI and replace it with a simple conversion action that only converts the Brain Dump draft text into multiple distinct task items (using the existing local deterministic extraction logic).",
      "reason": "The diff shows a new handler named handleConvertToTasks and use of extractTasksFromBrainDump(), but the UI section that renders the action/button is not included in the truncated snippet, so it cannot be confirmed that the \"Energy Assistant\" button/label is removed and replaced with a single primary action labeled with neutral wording (e.g., \"Convert to Tasks\").",

      "requirement": "Update Brain Dump view helper copy to remove references to an “Energy Assistant” and describe the conversion behavior as splitting the brain dump into individual tasks (English user-facing text).",
      "reason": "No helper/description copy is shown in the provided truncated BrainDumpView diff. There is no explicit evidence in the diff summary that user-facing description text was updated to remove \"Energy Assistant\" mentions and explain task splitting behavior.",
