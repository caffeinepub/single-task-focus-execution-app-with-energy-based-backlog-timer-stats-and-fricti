  "summary": "React-based Focus & Execution Management System: a single-task focus app that shows one task at a time, supports energy-based task selection, backlog management, timer, step checklist, notes, stats, friction logging, plus a home-page brain-dump intake that can be converted into tasks; now includes AI-assisted parsing to turn freeform brain dumps into individual task items, with optional assistant-based categorization, all with persistent async storage.",
  "architectural_notes": [
    "Persist data via async window.storage with keys: 'current-task', 'tasks-backlog', 'current-energy', 'user-stats'.",
    "Task model includes: id, title, why, energy, steps, estimatedMinutes, completedSteps, note, lastFriction{reason,timestamp}.",
    "Stats model includes: completed, streak, totalTime (minutes).",
    "UI should update optimistically and save in background; all storage operations wrapped in try/catch; missing keys handled gracefully.",
    "Build as a single React .jsx artifact using hooks (useState/useEffect) and lucide-react icons.",
    "Brain Dump should optionally support speech-to-text input (e.g., via Web Speech API) behind a mic button, appending transcribed text into the draft brain-dump field.",
    "Brain Dump conversion must reliably segregate a single freeform dump into multiple discrete task items (not one combined task); allow AI-assisted parsing to improve splitting accuracy.",
    "Brain Dump extractor should better split speech-to-text/run-on paragraphs by detecting multi-task markers (e.g., and/then/also/after that, semicolons, bullets) while avoiding over-splitting short phrases.",
    "Brain Dump deletion/clearing must not remove or affect tasks already converted/added to 'tasks-backlog'; tasks and brain-dump state are persisted and managed independently."

  "known_issues": [
    "Focus button does not consistently navigate back to the Home page from all views/screens.",
    "Streak details are not reliably visible/accessible from the Home page.",
    "Tasks created from Brain Dump are being removed/lost when the Brain Dump is deleted/cleared; converted tasks should remain in the tasks list/backlog."
