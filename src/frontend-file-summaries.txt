  "frontend/src/App.tsx": "Thin wrapper component that renders the main FocusExecutionApp component.",
  "frontend/src/FocusExecutionApp.jsx": "Complete single-file Focus & Execution Management System with centralized handleGoHome function, streak display, Brain Dump integration that creates one backlog task per extracted BrainDumpItem, manual task addition via AddTaskModal, and hardened Brain Dump clearing that only affects Brain Dump storage keys (brain-dump-draft and brain-dump-items) without touching the tasks-backlog persistence.",
  "frontend/src/index.css": "Global styles with Google Fonts (Crimson Pro and Work Sans), warm color palette in OKLCH format, custom shadow utilities, and animation keyframes for slide-up, fade-in, scale-in, stagger, and pulse effects.",
  "frontend/index.html": "HTML entry point with Google Fonts preconnect and links for Crimson Pro and Work Sans typography.",
  "frontend/tailwind.config.js": "Extended Tailwind configuration with warm shadow utilities (shadow-warm, shadow-warm-lg) and custom animation keyframes/utilities for the specified cubic-bezier easing and timing requirements.",
  "frontend/src/lib/taskEnergyClassifier.ts": "Local deterministic classifier that analyzes task text using keyword matching, complexity indicators, and time patterns to suggest one of four energy categories (DEEP/STEADY/LOW/NONE) with an explanation and confidence level; works offline without external AI/LLM calls.",
  "frontend/src/components/TaskEnergyAssistant.tsx": "Chatbot-style assistant component with message history, input form, and category suggestion display; supports standalone usage and integration with Add Task modal via optional props for initial text and apply callback.",
  "frontend/src/components/BrainDumpView.tsx": "Brain Dump component with \"Convert to Tasks\" action using enhanced local smart parsing to split multiline and speech-to-text input into categorized task items; includes helper text clarifying that clearing Brain Dump only removes items from the Brain Dump view and does not delete tasks already added to the Backlog; handles classification errors gracefully, tracks manual category overrides, and supports speech-to-text with visual feedback.",
  "frontend/src/hooks/useSpeechToText.ts": "Custom React hook that wraps the browser's Web Speech API (SpeechRecognition) to provide speech-to-text functionality with feature detection, listening state management, error handling, and transcript accumulation for voice input in the Brain Dump view.",
  "frontend/src/lib/brainDumpTaskExtractor.ts": "Enhanced local deterministic task extractor that preserves newline boundaries by normalizing each line individually (not globally), reliably splits speech-to-text run-on paragraphs using connector patterns (and then, then, also, next, etc.), and filters out invalid fragments while maintaining multiple distinct tasks from mixed input formats.",
  "frontend/src/components/FocusHomeButton.tsx": "Reusable button component that renders a \"Focus\" control with Target icon and calls an onActivate callback to return to the home view.",
  "frontend/src/components/EnergyCategorySelector.tsx": "Reusable energy category selector component that displays the four energy levels (DEEP, STEADY, LOW, NONE) as selectable cards with icons, labels, and descriptions using the ENERGY_LEVELS metadata.",
  "frontend/src/components/AddTaskModal.tsx": "Modal dialog component for manually adding tasks with fields for title, why, energy category selection, steps, and estimated time; uses shadcn/ui components and the EnergyCategorySelector for category selection."
